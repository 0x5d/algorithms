# Inversion count

**Inversion**: A pair _i_, _j_, such that j > i and A[_j_] < A[_i_].

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in a given file, where the _i_ th row of the file
indicates the _i_ th entry of an array.

Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm.
